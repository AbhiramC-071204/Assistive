I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully designed and developed a responsive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 🎉

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of front-end web development fundamentals and how different technologies work together to build interactive and user-friendly web interfaces.

🔧 Technologies Used:

HTML5 – For structuring the webpage

CSS3 – For styling, layout, and responsive design

JavaScript – For interactivity and dynamic behavior

✨ Key Highlights:

Fully responsive design (works on mobile, tablet, and desktop)

Clean and structured UI

Improved user experience with basic interactivity

Followed best practices for layout and styling

This project boosted my confidence in building real-world web applications and motivated me to explore advanced concepts like frameworks and APIs next.

I’m open to feedback, suggestions, and collaboration opportunities.
Looking forward to learning and growing every day! 💻📈
